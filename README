lunaticlib is a set of small python libraries for making use of
.dlw and .jsp files, as used by several games by Hamumu.com

The libraries require pygame to work. So if things utterly fail,
that's probably the problem.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The JSP class in jsp.py loads a jsp file, and stores it as a series
of frames. The simplest way to then draw one of the images is

	JSP.draw_image( image_id, surface, position )
	
Pass this function the id of the image you want to draw, the pygame
surface you want to draw it onto, and the position as (x,y), and it
will draw it, taking the image's offset into account. If the image
id is invalid, it'll write a message to the console, but carry on
gracefully.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The World class in world.py is still quite buggy, and a bit badly
written. Figure it out yourself if you wish. I will document it
better when it works properly.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The biggest TODO is, of course, being able towrite these file types
as well as read them. Also, I'm going to rewrite the level rendering
to have shadows, and speed it up a lot. Hopefully get it to display
items, too.

This is a test change.
